# I18n

## During development

With `ni` ([link](https://github.com/antfu/ni))

```shell
nr dev
```

With npm

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, as well as watch the translation files and rebuild them when needed.

## Using translations

a `t` (aka translate) store is provided for translating source text.

```typescript
$t("Hello World");

// es.json
{
    "Hello World": "Ola Mundo"
}
```

**Note that there is no need for an english translation, because the source text is already the translation.**

Sometimes, if you have long strings, you might want an english translation context.

```typescript
// DO:
$t("extendedDescription")

//en.json
{
    "extendedDescription": "This is an extended description\nwith multiple newlines."
}

// DONT:
$t(`This is an extended description
with multiple newlines.`)

// Because then fr.json would look like
{
    "This is an extended description\nwith multiple newlines.": "Ceci est une description etendue\navec plusieurs nouvelles lignes"
}

```

Usage:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import { onDestroy } from "svelte";
    import { t, locale } from "../lib/i18n"

    let now = Date.now();
    const timer = setInterval(() => now = Date.now(), 1000);
    onDestroy(() => clearInterval(timer));
</script>

<h1>Current Language: {$locale}</h1>

<p>{$t("plain")}</p> <!-- Note that this one doesn't need an english translation, because the source text is the translation. -->
<p>{$t("interpolated", {count: 10 })}</p>
<p>{$t("time", {now: now})}</p>
<p>{$t("number", {n: 10})}</p>
<p>{$t("selected", {gender: "male"})}</p>
<p>{$t("pluralized", {count: 10})}</p>
<p>{$t("pluralized-with-hash", {count: 10})}</p>
```

Since the source is written directly in the default locale, there's often no need for a translation file for it.

Exceptions are:

- Long strings: `$t("a super long string very very long")`
    -> The translation would be `"a super long string very very long": "une chaîne vraiment longue très très longue",`

Which is quite cumbersome.

- Strings with automatic newlines

```svelte
$t(`a
multiline
string`)
```

-> The translation would be `"a\nmultiline\nstring": "une\nchaîne\nmultiligne",`

Which again is a pain.

- String with transformers such as plurals, genders, select, etc, because these need to be compiled at bundling time. (i.e. with `npm run build:translations`)
